# Tunde Adetunji

<p>Started out in 2009 when I tried creating School Management software for schools. I knew very little, but I had a big dream, and I learnt .Net Framework, SQL, Java and Android along the way. In my next employment, I was able to apply what I learnt to my work building customer-facing applications. By then, I already had libraries of over 30, 000 lines of code (see <a href="https://github.com/tundeadetunji/all_modules" target="blank">this repo</a>), and that came in handy for day to day work.</p>

<p>I am passionate about contributing to bringing about the wow factor that the user feels when using a product I built or help build - be it inhouse, B2B or direct customers.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tundeadetunji/" target="blank">LinkedIn</a>âœŒ - I'd be happy to learn what I can do for you.</p> 

<p>Have a good one!ðŸ˜€</p>
